Order of execution

1. Run camera.py with python2 in order to generate the IK and dump it to a SQL table
2. Execute the sql binary with `sudo ./sql`
	This will wait for an Enter keypress, don't press it yet
	We setup SPI pins but do not begin sending data yet
3. Load the program onto the DragonBoard and execute it
	DragonBoard is now waiting for first SPI communication
4. Hit enter in the terminal with the running sql binary to begin sending SPI data
	Terminal from step 2
5. Watch in amazement as the robot works (I hope)
